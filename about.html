            <h1>What is RDMD's mission?</h1>
            <p>Over half of the world's population relies on rice as a staple diet, making it a vital commodity for global agriculture. <br>However, a number of illnesses that can negatively affect both yield and quality present serious obstacles to the production of rice. Rice illnesses can result in significant financial losses and affect food security. 
            <br>These diseases are caused by pathogens such fungus, bacteria, and viruses, as well as by pests and environmental conditions.<br>This is where RDMD aims to solve the problem, by identifying and analyzing these problems, we can work to find a cure based and prevent future diseases from affecting future rice fields from infestations.</p>
